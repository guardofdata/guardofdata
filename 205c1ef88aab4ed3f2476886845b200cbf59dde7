When running Guard of Data on Windows XP before this change there are 2 events (debug strings) generated when saving new file in Notepad:
MOVE new.txt -> new.txt
CREATE new.txt


After ‘After that ReadDirectoryChangesTest outputted:’ there should be:
```
--------------
ADDED Release\new.txt
--------------
ADDED Release\new.txt
MODIFIED Release\new.txt
MODIFIED Release\new.txt
REMOVED Release\new.txt
```
(This is important because if new.txt file is not in sub directory, then there are no skipped actions.)
